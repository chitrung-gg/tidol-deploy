### About the Website
A Website that offers users a seamless experience when reading books across multiple devices. 

This Website provides more extra features such as following books, history of all read chapters, comments...

### About Cloud Deployment
OpenShift Developer Sandbox makes migration process from local to remote quite uncomplicated, with lots of tools available for a number of usecases related.

To deploy the Website, only a small subset of its features was used:
- Use code directly from repository, clone and then build as images to run as a container
- Use template images (PostgreSQL) to quickly bring up a database instance
- Code, build, test directly on development server, without the needs of making changes to the original repository
- Serverless runtime (only run when has access), automatically handle routing and DNS nameservers
- High availability with config (min/max pods running)
- Monitor containers' health and extract logs through dashboards
